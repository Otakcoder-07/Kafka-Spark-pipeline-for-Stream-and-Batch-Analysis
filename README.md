# Project Setup

This guide provides instructions for setting up the necessary Python libraries for this project, including Flask, PyMongo, Confluent Kafka, and PySpark.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have `pip3` installed. If not, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

## Python Version

Any version of Python as of April 17, 2024, should be compatible with these installations.

## Installation Instructions

Open your terminal and run the following commands to install the required libraries:

### Flask
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) is a micro web framework written in Python.

```sh
pip3 install flask
```

### PyMongo
[PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a Python distribution containing tools for working with MongoDB.

```sh
pip3 install pymongo
```

### Confluent Kafka
[Confluent Kafka](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/confluent-kafka-python/html/index.html) is a Python client for Apache Kafka.

```sh
pip3 install confluent_kafka
```

### PySpark
[PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/index.html) is the Python API for Apache Spark.

```sh
pip3 install pyspark
```

Follow the above tutorials for a comprehensive guide on using Spark, MongoDB, and Kafka in your projects.

## Verification

After installation, you can verify the installations by importing the libraries in a Python script or an interactive Python session:

```python
import flask
import pymongo
import confluent_kafka
import pyspark
```

If there are no import errors, the libraries have been installed successfully.

## Conclusion

You have now installed the necessary libraries for Flask, PyMongo, Confluent Kafka, and PySpark. Refer to the provided resources for detailed tutorials on how to use these libraries in your projects.
